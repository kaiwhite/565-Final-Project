# 565-Final-Project
UNC Machine Learning Final Project

The team members are Colin Liebe and Kai White. The dataset we are using is data of every NFL player that threw at least one pass in the NFL from 2009 to 2018. It can be found on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omzqwonxei/nfl-passing-statistics-20092018?select=pass-2010.csv Our goal with the project is the determine the importance of good quarterback play for team success. The first thing we did was clean the data. We plan on first doing a basic regression technique in order to try to get weights for each statistic to determine the importance features in deciding wins. We also plan on using dimensionality reduction to remove unnecessary information. Since we have all the information, we will focus on supervised learning techniques. We are still open to multiple techniques at this point as we are still in the cleaning phase.
